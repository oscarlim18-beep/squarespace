        the purposes of customer research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so. We may also be required to disclose such information 
        to regulators, lawyers, auditors, other companies in the same group, third party service providers and appointed marketing agency.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Your Consent</h2>

      </p>

      <h2>3. Communication & Marketing</h2>
      <p>
        If you have made a purchase from our store we may occasionally update you on our latest products, news and special offers via e-mail, post & telephone.

      <h2>4. Site Statistics</h2>
      <p>
        We may disclose aggregate, anonymised statistics about the number of visitors to this Website or number of purchases made as required by our investors. 
        We use an independent measurement and research company to gather data regarding the visitors to this Website on our behalf using cookies and code which 
        is embedded in the site. Both the cookies and the embedded code provide statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual 
        page view, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors' screen settings and other general information. 
        SSPACE EQUITY SDN BHD uses and stores this type of information, as with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, 
        to help it improve the services to its users. Further information regarding the way in which this information is obtained and used can be obtained by contacting us.

        <li>In the event that SSPACE EQUITY SDN BHD sells or buys any business or assets.</li>
        <li>If SSPACE EQUITY SDN BHD or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data which we hold about our customers may be one of the transferred assets.</li>
        <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SSPACE EQUITY SDN BHD, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>6. Third Party Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Our site may contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and other third parties. 
        If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility 
        or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Checking Your Details</h2>
      <p>
        If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to SSPACE EQUITY SDN BHD you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address or address given below. 
        Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information.
